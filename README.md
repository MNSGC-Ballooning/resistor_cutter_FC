# resistor_cutter_FC
Flight computer for a standalone resistor cutter box.

This flight computer allows for balloon cutaway in any of five scenarios.4
1) The stack surpasses a user-set maximum altitude.
2) The stack drifts out of user-set geographic boundaries.
3) A master timer expires.
4) A pressure timer, which begins after a certain altitude is calculated from a pressure-altitude equation, expires.
5) The stack is detected to be in a "slow ascent" state.
